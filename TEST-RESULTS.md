node test-webhook.js https://your-app.vercel.app/api/github-webhook

# Test with webhook simulation
node test-webhook.js https://your-app.vercel.app/api/github-webhook your-secret
```

## Integration Points Tested

### GitHub Webhook
- ✅ Signature verification
- ✅ Event type detection
- ✅ Payload parsing
- ✅ Pull request data extraction

### Discord Integration
- ✅ Client initialization (mocked)
- ✅ Channel fetching (mocked)
- ✅ Message sending (mocked)
- ✅ Error handling

### Vercel Deployment
- ✅ Serverless function structure
- ✅ API route configuration
- ✅ Environment variable setup
- ✅ Body parsing disabled for HMAC

## Test Environment

- **Node.js:** 18+
- **Jest:** 30.2.0
- **Test Framework:** ES Modules
- **Mocking:** Jest mocks for Discord.js

## Deployment Readiness Checklist

- [x] All tests passing
- [x] No security vulnerabilities
- [x] Project structure verified
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Environment variables documented
- [x] .gitignore properly configured
- [x] Manual testing script available
- [x] Deployment guide available

## Known Limitations

1. **Console Output in Tests:** The error handling test intentionally triggers and catches errors, resulting in expected console.error output during test runs.

2. **Discord Mocking:** Tests use mocked Discord client. Real Discord integration should be tested after deployment with actual credentials.

3. **GitHub Events:** Currently only handles `pull_request.opened` events. Other events are accepted but not processed.

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Monitor Vercel Logs:** Keep an eye on function invocations and errors
2. **Test with Real PR:** After deployment, create a test PR to verify end-to-end flow
3. **Discord Permissions:** Ensure bot has proper permissions in the target channel
4. **Webhook Delivery:** Monitor GitHub webhook delivery logs for failures
5. **Rotate Secrets:** Regularly update the webhook secret and Discord token

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Vercel: `vercel --prod`
2. Configure environment variables
3. Set up GitHub webhook
4. Test with a real pull request
5. Monitor logs and adjust as needed

## Contact & Support

For issues or questions:
- Review the comprehensive guides in `README.md`, `TESTING.md`, and `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Check Vercel logs for runtime errors
- Verify environment variables are correctly set
- Test webhook signature generation
